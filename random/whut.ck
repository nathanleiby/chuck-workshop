GCube cube --> GG.scene();
// (1.0/60.0) => float dt;
while (true) {
//   dt => cube.rotY;  // animate something, anything
//   dt::second => now;  // wait 1/60th of a second
//   second => now;
    // GG.nextFrame() => now;
}

// And for the curious reader I'll leave these questions:
// Exercise: Why doesn't the above code work??? What's really going on here?
