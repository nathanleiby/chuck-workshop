# orbits

## Design

- UI
    - 2d: https://space-facts.com/planet-orbits/
    - later: 3d seems nice for excellent camera and lightin
- Audio
    - ideas:
      - reverb:
        - JCR
        - built-in chugin: [GVerb](https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/reference/chugins.html#GVerb)
        - chugi via chump: https://plinkysynth.com/
      - pads:
        - filtered saw waves into a nice reverb
          - maybe a gating effect?
        - Lead303 ... PulseOsc => LPF => ASDR => outlet;
        - throw on... filter/reverb/delay
      - instruments: Strings, brief keys
      - Space sounds:
        - Hans Zimmer interstellar
          - FM7 (no 5) -> G7 (no 5) -> Asus2 .. sus? major 7 and major 9
        - Mass Effect
          - low wombing
        - star trek
    - Polyrhythm aligned with orbit cycle of the planet
      - noise every time it..
        - does a full cycle?
        - or at various 'notches' along the loop?
        - diff planets are "every 1, every 2, every 4, every 8"  .. maybe this is part of the randomness? or you can adjust the "intensity" of a planet
      - visual correspondence .. a planet should activate somehow when it creates sound
        - sound is on or off... can we show that?
          - [x] changed size and brightness
          - e.g. email particles at start of making sound
        - sound has a length.. can we show that?
          - e.g. "trail" when making sound (i like carving arcs)

- "feel"
  - goal: creative exploration
  - soaring, sense of scope and grandiosity
  - sense of emptiness being filled with creation
  - divine clockmaker
  - zoom in and out? from small to really expansive solar system -> galaxy -> universe sounds amazing!

## RANDOM

- audio "beats" -- could they trigger something more than a single note (boring?)
  - play a sample?
    - shaker (chuk-uh)
  - play a riff (1.. 1. 1.)
  - sometimes might want "off" beats (2,4,6,8) instead of down/on beats (1,3,5,7)
    - e.g. kick vs snare
    - e.g. 'disco' hihat alternation
- visually, consider starting loop from "north" for better symmetry
- consider non-circle shapes that show polyrhythm more clearly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA-gDB1HWuQ&ab_channel=Wangbw
- inspiration: mini-metro .. new stations pop up periodically and you have to manage them! you're stuck with it!
- could we use the snowstorm particle effect to give the sense of space off stars far away?
- Could you choose a central object for orbital speeds? "gravity" + music
- "moondulator" -- use moons to modulate planet behavior?
  - rings -- saturn style rings as another planet modulator?
- planets
  - of different colors
  - of different types (gas giant, exoplanet, etc)
- should we associate actual gravity equations with cycles
- "chord nebulas" -
  - color of a region donates color of sound
- "clock" of the galaxy
- viewpoints:
  - universe (start with different abstract "space" noise in the background as a base palette?)
  - galaxy (full sequencer loop)
  - solar system (one instrument loop)
    - the "nth" orbit/ring denotes "N notes per loop" measure of the sequence
  - planet -- one rhythm / sequence
    - could it zoom in more? cyclical activity on a planet? (day / night cycle?)
  - moon (modulator on a planet)
- if possible, allow saving/load a universe (autosave?), since it's a lot of work to build!
- planets:
  - rotate
  - tilt
  - day night
- something exciting when it all the polyrhythms align? "syzygy" moment
- it'd be cool if you could click the "viewpoint" and move to it.
  - e.g. click a sun (or its orbit) to zoom into that solar system
- [elliptical orbits](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1979/why-are-most-planetary-orbits-nearly-circular)
- polyrhythm tier list https://youtu.be/gEkYwxRcyIk?si=XSPqXWNFS5ex8XGO
- audio vibe ideas:
  - (chillhop / triphop) "You Wish" - by Nightmares on Wax
  - "Teardrop" - Massive Attack
- "storyteller" - magic camera controller that zooms in on relatively active / interesting part of simulation
  - e.g. maybe it's the loud drum, but perhaps it's a newly added element, even if less loud
  - could it apply a filter/lens to the overall view? e.g. based on verse, chorus, bridge
  - after building your composition, this let's you step back and enjoy it!
- accidental fun -- pulsing ring from center..

  - huge tick radius -- see screenshot
- interaction:
  - how does the user choose to add/remove planets?
  - how does the user toggle sounds/sfx
    - ex: left click -- create or delete
    - ex: right click -- modulate sound
- crazy idea-- allow "undo" in case you delete mistakenly!!
- visual variety, visual interest:
  - orbit angles
- for each component type, consider variants
  - sun types:
    - binary star (whoa could the sun itself have a rhythm due to that?)
      - in general, objects co-orbiting sounds interesting! [example](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect13/lecture13.html)
    - white dwarf
    - supergiant
- how to show the orbit?
  - consider showing orbit as a trail, vs full solid circle
  - or variants: lighter/dotted/dash-dotted/etc
