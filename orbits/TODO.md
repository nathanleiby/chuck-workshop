# TODO

## Tasks
- [x] ensure orbit position matches loop position
  - [x] v1, all orbits angles are synced visually (e.g. 'East' at same time)
- [ ] Allow adding an removing components
  - [ ] planets
    - [x] adding
    - [ ] removing
  - [ ] solar systems
- [x] fix circles to align with offset "step", too
  - forced alignment, for now! no OFFBEATS :(
- [ ] make planets orbit in same system
- [ ] as you add more planets, zoom out to fit contents
- [ ] Add another solar system
  - [ ] allow some variation in SolarSystem sound (e.g. different synth per system)
- allow some sound variation
  - [ ] planets
  - [ ] by system
- [ ] change focus (zoom in/out)
- [ ] Add a texture to the planet

## Questions

- [x] How do I add bloom to objects
- [..] How do I put a texture on an orb?
  - we did 2d texture so probably good enough for now
- [ ] Any tips on creating a "space" like effect? (e.g. shaders, particles)
