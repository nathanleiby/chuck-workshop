# TODO

## Tasks
- [x] add a global clock with chords/colors, so there's a sense of song / movement (1h)
  - [x] walk up 1->4
  - [x] try another song / form

- [ ] make prettier sounds - samples, etc (2h)
  - [ ] Consider making each "tone" planet play at a random octave, for less collision among sync'd sounds


AESTHETIC

- Camera should change
- Allow increasing tempo over time - hard, let's skip
