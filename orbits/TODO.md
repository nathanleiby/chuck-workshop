# TODO

## Tasks
- [x] add a global clock with chords/colors, so there's a sense of song / movement (1h)
  - [x] walk up 1->4
  - [x] try another song / form

- [ ] make prettier sounds - samples, etc (2h)
  - [x] try a few better constructed synths?
    - [ ] stacked synths
    - [ ] reverb
    - [ ] delay
    - rhodey is working well!
  - [ ] adjust sound duration
  - [x] Consider making each "tone" planet play at a random octave, for less collision among sync'd sounds - tried it. the effect isn't as nice as hoped.
- [x] visually spacing orbits better would help
- [ ] spinning cosmos to explain global "song"
- [x] change zoom level
  - [x] explored
  - [ ] figured out final zoom
- [ ] add/removing planets / sounds could help a lot for composition aspect.
- [ ] global filter going up and down
