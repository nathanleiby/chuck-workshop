## Tasks
Draw the sun
Draw a planet
Draw the planet's orbit
Play a sound every time the planet arrives at its start location

## Questions

- [x] How do I add bloom to objects
- [ ] How do I put a texture on an orb?
  - we did 2d texture so probably good enough for now
- [ ] Any tips on creating a "space" like effect? (e.g. shaders, particles)
