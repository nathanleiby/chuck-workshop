# TODO

## Tasks
- [ ] Associate sounds with planet orbits
  - cycle length
  - beats per cycle
  - sound is on or off... can we show that?
    - e.g. change color when sound is active
    - e.g. email particles at start of making sound
  - sound has a length.. can we show that? e.g. "trail" when making sound
- [ ] Allow adding an removing planets
- [ ] Add another solar system
  - [ ] allow some variation in SolarSystem sound (e.g. different synth per system)
- [ ] change focus (zoom in/out)
- [ ] Add a texture to the planet

## Questions

- [x] How do I add bloom to objects
- [..] How do I put a texture on an orb?
  - we did 2d texture so probably good enough for now
- [ ] Any tips on creating a "space" like effect? (e.g. shaders, particles)
