- orbits - 3d bodies orbiting but various polythyhms
- Space Invaders clone -- tempo increases
- Godot connector
	- Allow embedding Chuck within a Godot game --
	- could use this to build the above again, too
- Shadow duel
	- could be a "movie" or game
	- animate fighting  shapes and time animations with music
- Doom in Chuck
	- but with lots of audio shenanigans?!
- Write Rubberband algo myself -- integrate into ChucK
  - WarpBuf may already have solved this(!)
- Billie Jean floor
- Song Clock
- Any audio vizualizer
- Visualize state of the audio chain
  - each component in audio graph has a look
